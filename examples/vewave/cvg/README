Convergence test for two- and three-dimensional, anisotropic, linear elastic
solver.  2D tests are run against a two by two (meter) square with 0.2, 0.15,
0.1, 0.05 cell edge sizes::

  ./go run cvg2d_200 cvg2d_150 cvg2d_100 cvg2d_50

3D tests are run against a two by two by two (meter) cube with 0.5, 0,4, 0.2,
0.15, 0.1 cell edge sizes::

  ./go run cvg3d_500 cvg3d_400 cvg3d_200 cvg3d_150 cvg3d_100

The meshes are generated by calling Gmsh on the fly.  The wave vector is set to
(pi, pi) or (pi, pi, pi).

A command line tool is provided to analyze the order of convergence of error
after the arrangements are run::

  ./go converge

The above execution process is automated in a script::

  ./runme.sh
