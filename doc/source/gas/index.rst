.. py:module:: solvcon.parcel.gas

This package :py:mod:`~solvcon.parcel.gas` contains code that perform
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for gas flows by using the CESE method.  The
model equations employed right now are the Euler equations and will then be
updated to the Navier-Stokes equations.
