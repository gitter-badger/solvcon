The CESE Method
===============

The space-time `Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method
<http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/microbus/>`__ is a numerical method designed for
solving linear and nonlinear first-order hyperbolic partial differential
equations (PDEs).  The method was originally developed for solving aerodynamic
problems [Chang95]_.
