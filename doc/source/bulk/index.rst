.. py:module:: solvcon.parcel.bulk

This package :py:mod:`solvcon.parcel.bulk` contains code that perform
computational hydra acoustics (CHA) by using the CESE method.  The model
equations employed are the continuity equation and the momentum equations.  To
relate the density to the pressure, the definition of bulk modulus is employed.
