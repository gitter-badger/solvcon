SOLVCON is a collection of `Python <http://www.python.org>`__-based
conservation-law solvers that use the space-time `Conservation Element and
Solution Element (CESE) method <http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/microbus/>`__.
SOLVCON targets at solving problems that can be formulated as a system of
first-order, linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs).
